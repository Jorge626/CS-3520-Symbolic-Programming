# CS-3520-Symbolic-Programming
This repository stores a couple assignemtns and a project from my class CS 3520 - Symbolic Programming.
I took this course at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona

- Assignment 1 solves a few problems using LISP. Questions can be found in a PNG file in the folder.
- Assignment 2 solves a few problems using Prolog. Questions can be found in a PNG file in the folder.
- The project is a list manipulator using Prolog. Users can sort the list, compute the sum, and find the greatest element in the list.

## Things I learned in this course
